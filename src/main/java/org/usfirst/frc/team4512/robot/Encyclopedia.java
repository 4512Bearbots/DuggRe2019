    /** Ternary operators
     * 
     Basically, a shortened if loop.
     Ternary operators are usually used to perform basic true/false switches, 
    although they have the capability of a normal if 'control' statement.
     Take this translation for example:

     if(statement){
         int a = b;
     }else{
         int a = 1;
     }

      vv into vv

     int a = (statement)?b:1;

     (statement) -- parentheses for boolean evaluation
     
     ? -- denotes that this is a ternary operator
     
     ?b:1; if (statement) is true, the value(a) equals first term(b), otherwise the second(1)      seen as ?if(true):if(false);
     
     Use this operator if you need to do simple one-line if statements. Anything that needs multiple statements should just use a normal if.
